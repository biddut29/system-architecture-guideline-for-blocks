## What is System Architecture?

System architecture is a blueprint that defines the structure, interaction, and deployment of software components, databases, and infrastructure. It ensures the system is scalable, maintainable, secure, and resilient, enabling smooth operation across distributed environments.

### Key Design Principles:

**Modular Microservices Design**: Independent services for better maintainability and scaling.

**Separation of Responsibilities**:
- **Web Services (API Layer)**: Handle synchronous client requests
- **Host Services (Worker Layer)**: Process background tasks, heavy reports, and schedulers

**Event-Driven Architecture**: RabbitMQ ensures asynchronous communication between services.

**Real-Time Notification Layer**: WebSockets and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for instant updates.

**Observability**: Integrated monitoring and centralized logging across all services.

- **Notification Service**: Manages various types of notifications
- **Business Web Service**: REST APIs for real-time business operations
- **Business Host Service**: Handles background tasks, batch processing, and scheduled workflows

## Notification & Event Flow

### 3.1 Event Workflow

User performs an action (e.g., submits a request).

Web Service updates the database and publishes an event to the message queue.

Background Service or other microservices consume this event asynchronously.

Results are processed, and responses are sent back to the client (if needed).

### 3.2 Notification Workflow

Notification Service listens to message queue for events like "Task Completed."

For active users, updates are pushed through real-time communication.

For offline/mobile users, push notifications are sent.
